TODO:
- Add dropdown/slide-in-out transition for the dropbox
- Change the hover to the respective color of the element (see Dropdown for more info)
- Design every other page + begin implementation with the color schemes.
- Figure out the Typist.
- Might be nice to have the CSS placement of the pages be dependent/dynamic with regards to the dropdwon.
- Smooth transitions. (animatinos)
